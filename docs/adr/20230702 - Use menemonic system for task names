We want cloud-janitor to be easy to use, and not re-create the complexity and variety of command line tools that already exist. From now we'll be using the following mnemonic system:

$ cloud-janitor <domain> <action> <object> <profile>

Domain: The task domain, e.g. "aws", "gcp", "cloud", "logs", "translate" and so on.

Action: The action to perform, e.g. "list", "delete", "create", "update" and so on.

Object: The object to perform the action on, e.g. "cluster", "instances", "config", "users" and so on.

Profile: The set of configuration variables to use ("cluster name=mycluster", "instance type=t3.nano", "ssh_key=..." )

For backwards compatibility, tasks by name, we'll also support the following:

$ cloud-janitor domain-action-object-profile

"domain-action-object-profile" being the new standard for task names

<domain> is required. If it is not set or not found, bypass mode will execute the provided command line, with the configured templates and packages , if any.
<action> <object> <profile> are all optional and can be committed if there are only one of each.

Examples:
$ cloud-janitor openshift create cluster prod
$ cloud-janitor openshift create cluster
$ cloud-janitor eks create cluster
$ cloud-janitor logs put
$ cloud-janitor translate
$ cloud-janitor transcribe


Tasks will be refactored as they are maintained, another ADR will be added when all tasks adhere to this standard, hopefully marking release 2.0.0.
