# Cloud Janitor

TL;DR: A collection of scripts to automate tasks in cloud computing, like create clusters or cleanup accounts.

For example, in a 'create-cluster' task, cloud-janitor should execute all the commands or scripts necessary to validate and backup configuration,
install dependencies, create account-level resources, create cluster-level resources, wait for health check, install plugins and verify the application. 
All that from a single invocation, using a command line like `cloud-janitor -t openshift-create-cluster` or the equivalent inside a container, github action or gitpod.io workspace.

## Motivation

As developers and sysadmins we are used to building scripts and solutions to automate tasks. 
However, sharing those solutions can be difficult as they are executed in different machines and contexts.
This often leads to a lot of duplication of effort and code to perform the same tasks, such as creating clusters or cleaning up accounts.

Cloud Janitor is a tool to automate and share complex maintenance and troubleshooting tasks in cloud computing. 
It's built considering the security and flexibility requirements found in operating real-world production workloads.

In cloud computing, many responsibilities are shared between the provider and the consumer of services. 
This tool's goal is to share automations that customers and partners frequently need to build themselves, often with minimal differences.

A key automation in this context is "cleaning up" an AWS account, for example. That will be a bit different in each environment, but it's all about filtering and deleting (or replacing) resources. Here's how our features can help:

**Easy to Run and Configure** - All settings are exposed as environment variables and code can run as CLI, jar, container, github action or your preferred CI/CD tool.

**Simple to customize and extend** - Take custom actions, such as scale down or notify, instead of delete.

**Defensive Defaults** - No writes are executed unless the "dry run" setting is explicitly disabled.

**Resource Filtering** - Only the matched resources, and their dependents, are deleted.

**Logs & Reporting** - Keep a record of invocations and their results for queries, visualization and audits.

**Rate Limiting** - API limits and throttling are respected with backoffs.

Cloud Janitor is also built to be easily extensible and contributions are most welcome!

## Cloud Janitor on GitPod

This repository is ready to launch on gitpod, containing all configuration to start your development instance with Java, Quarkus, AWS CLI and all tools that you need to code.

Once your workspace is running use the command ```aws configure``` to setup your AWS account authentication. You can also use gitpod environment variables or dotfiles for that purpose. Check that authentication is correct with the command ```aws sts get-caller-identity```

You can run cloud-janitor in development mode by executing ```quarkus dev```, ```mvn quarkus:dev``` or simply running the class ```cj.Application```. The default task is called "marvin" and is mostly harmless. It will just log the most important reminder: "Don't panic" :) 

Ready to start janitoring? Check the ```LearningFromTests``` class for some examples.
